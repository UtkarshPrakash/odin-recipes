<p>Punjabi Chole Masala is one of the most popular vegetarian curry dishes in India. It is a chickpea curry cooked with onions, tomatoes and lots of spices. Chole is one of those core curries in northern India without which no party or wedding festivities is complete. I remember whenever we would call someone over for lunch or dinner, mom would almost always make chole (or rajma or dal makhani).</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Raw Chickpeas:</strong><p>To make authentic Punjabi chole, you need to start with raw chickpeas. Sure, you can make the recipe with canned chickpeas but it won’t have the same texture. I highly recommend using raw chickpeas and then soaking them overnight before using in the recipe.
    </p></li>
    <li><strong>Spices (whole and grounded):</strong><p>his chole masala recipe uses a lot of ground as well as whole spices like bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin etc. There is also a special blend of spices known as “chole masala or chana masala powder” that is used in this recipe. You can find this spice mix at Indian grocery stores or I have shared a quick recipe to make it at home below.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Ginger garlic paste:</strong><p>you can use either homemade ginger garlic paste or store bought. Homemade is recommended for maximum flavor.
    </p></li>
    <li><strong>Tomatoes & Onions:</strong><p>these make the base of this chole masala. The onions need to be very finely chopped or grated for this recipe and the tomatoes need to be pureed.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Black tea bags:</strong><p>you might notice an unusual ingredient in the form of black tea bags in this recipe. The tea bags are used only to give chole a dark color, they add nothing to the taste. You can skip them if you don’t care about the color of the chole. You can even use dried amla (gooseberry) to get this dark color.</p></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>To make this recipe in the instant pot, soak chickpeas overnight and then pressure cook with whole spices, salt and black tea bags for 20 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally. Do the step of making the masala on the stovetop for that deep chole flavor.

    You can do everything in one-pot too, in which case you will cook the masala first, then add the soaked chickpeas to the pot and pressure cook for 30 to 35 minutes. I like the convenience of one-pot cooking but for a nice Punjabi style chole, do make the masala separately and let the chole simmer on low heat. Trust me, it makes a difference.</p>
