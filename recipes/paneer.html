<p>Paneer Pasanda recipe is made with a sweet and spicy filling, stuffed between two pieces of the popular Indian cottage cheese a.k.a paneer, then dipped, fried and served in a lusciously smooth onion-tomato gravy. Make this delicious dish for your next celebration and witness the power of its excellence. While this restaurant-style Paneer Pasanda recipe is time-consuming, it is absolutely worth the hassle.</p>

<p>It doesn’t hurt that making this dish with friends or family is both fun AND greatly reduces the amount of time it takes to make.

If you’re craving the flavors of this stuffed paneer delicacy but don’t have the time or patience to make it, you can simply fry the paneer without stuffing it first.

The gravy is simple to assemble (like my Paneer Butter Masala recipe) and is similar to Makhani Gravy, except it has the addition of fried onion paste.
<br>
For an even simpler version of this recipe, feel free to use store bought fried onions for the paste. Just note that the flavor and quality of fresh ingredients is basically always going to be superior to store bought.</p>
